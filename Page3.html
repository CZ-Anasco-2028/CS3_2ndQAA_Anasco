                            You can help spread awareness and prevent suicide by educating your community, your peers, your family and etc. about suicde. 
                            You can do this by helping them learn about suicide prevention, mental health issues, and etc. You can also help by using social media responsibly. 
                            Don't just stand there at the bottom of the building waiting for the person to jump and live feed it, use social media
                            by showing the people the dangers, the causes, and the effects of suicide. You can also check on people
                            by just simply asking them it they're ok if they are struggling and help them. And if you have a feeling that they are lying, monitor them
                            and be sure that they are going to be safe.
