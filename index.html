                <h1>What is Suicide?</h1>
                    <p><h3>Suicide is an act of ending someone's own life. This is often the result of 
                    overwhelming emotional, psychological, or situational distres. People may experience 
                    thoughts of suicide due to factors such as bullying, stress, depression, anxiety, trauma, and etc.

                <h1>Which type of individual/s have a higher chance in committing Suicide?</h1>
                    <p><h3>People who have mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety 
                           have a higher chance in committing suicide because they have a sense of hopelessness, where 
                           they feel like they are uselss in the world and tend to isolate themselves within groups of people.
                           People who have trauma or abuse such as childhood trauma and sexual abuse can also commit suicide 
                           because they think that committing suicide is the only way that they escape the trauma and abuse that
                           they have experienced. People who have an addiction to using substances such as drinking alcohol and using drugs have a 
                           chance of committing suicide because addiction these substances can give the user depression because some people use these
                           substances as coping mechanisms for past-trauma and abuse. LGBTQ+ individual/s can also commit suicide because of the discrimination
                           and rejection that the world puts on them for not being the sexual orientation or gender identity which can lead to isoalation and axienty.

                <h1>What is going on inside the thoughts of someone who is about to commit suicide?</h1>
                    <p><h3>When someone is about to commit suicide, their thoughts are distorted, thus they
                           are unable to think properly and they are unable to talk to anyone. They have a hard 
                           time listening to anyone during the critical moment and will have a hard time to really contemplate their 
                           choice and if they should go through.

                <h1>Why don't some people talk about their suicidal thoughts?</h1>
                    <P><h3>People that have suicidal thoughts generally don't like to talk about their thoughts 
                        because they fear that they are going to get misjudged and/or misunderstood. They also 
                        don't want to burden their loved ones just because of the suicidal thoughts. Another reason is because they feel
                        the thoughts that they are having are unimportant and that no one can help them fix their thoughts. Lastly, they feel that 
                        there is lack in awareness and that help is unavailable.

                    Why don't more people spread awareness about Suicide?
                </h1>
                <p><h3>People don't spread awareness because they think that its "cringe" spreading
                    awarness about suicide. They think that they will get bullied if they spread awareness about 
                    suicide. People follow the algorythm of social media where they only spread awarenewss when a 
                    popular celebrity or popular person posts something on their account about suicide.
